# Boolean-Function-Simplifier

Code for the paper at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IxOtpS7gctzrNpO8dghEDezXOBHeaLKG.
In this paper we propose to efficiently simplify a boolean function compared to algorithmic methods such as Quine-McCluskey, Petrick's method by learning the mapping of Karnaugh maps to the minimal boolean representation. We show that the proposed method works equally well on larger number of variables and don't care situations.
 Proposed Method is Karnaugh_variation_padded.py and Kranaugh_variation_padded_x.py 
 Baseline methods are Lenet,Deep Columnar CNN,and Baselines 1-3 as mentioned in the paper.
